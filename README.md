# AI-Agentic-Design-Patterns-with-AutoGen.Net

`AutoGen.Net` implementation of [`AI-Agentic-Design-Patterns-with-AutoGen`](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/)

> [!Note]
> Some examples are not exactly match what python AutoGen does. This is because some libraries are not available in .NET. For example, we use Tic Tac Toe game as a tool to demonstrate the concept of tool use where the python one use Chess game. This is because the `chess` library is not available in .NET.
